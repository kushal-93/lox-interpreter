### running notes: 

* storing all literal as string in token
* no ```break``` keyword support in the doc. How complex is it gonna be if I add it?

### enhancement to the tutorial

* [x] not supporting multiline string token
* [] support block comment ```/*...*/```
* [x] support leading and trailing decimal point in numbers token (eg. ```.123```, ```123.``` will be valid tokens)
